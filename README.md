# CS-300-DSA
•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The core problem involved developing a C++ application for the Computer Science advisors at ABCU. This program needed to specifically in loading course data, printing an alphanumeric list of courses, and searching for a specific course and printing title and prerequisites.  
•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Project One
I analyzed several structures vector, hash table, and binary search tree. I created pseudocode that performed a Big O run-time and memory analysis. These data structures are fundamental in the design and allows someone to create the best structure that offers the best performance for the specifics of the application. For this particular project a structure that loads fast, searches fast, and easily sorts data. I recommended BST as it is good for fast searches and an ordered output.
	Project Two
	In the second project I created a course object, developed the file for parsing and loading logic, 
Implementing the menu, and coding algorithms for sorting and printing the full list and the ability to search and print individual course information. 
•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One challenge was parsing the prerequisite strings, I overcame this by developing a carefully formed parsing function including error checking and uses temporary objects to construct course instances before insertion. 
•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
These projects reinforced the importance of designing before coding. Moving forward my designing will begin with identifying the primary operations, analyzing performance requirements, and selecting data structure.
•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
These projects have helped my quality of coding. I used clear descriptive naming conventions and in-line comments to explain logic. I also separated the code into functions, the modularity of the program makes it highly adaptable for future requirements.
